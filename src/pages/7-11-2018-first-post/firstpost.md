excerpt: This is my first blog post. It goes into a bit of detail of what I want the blog to become and what I've been up to.

<p>Hello, if you are reading this, you have somehow stumbled upon my (Cole Walker's) developer blog.
Since this is my first ever blog post, I'd like to spend at least a small portion outlaying the overall goal of this blog,
and what I hope it can turn into. 
</p>
<p>
I created this blog with the purpose of developing an online prescence for myself in a professional light.
While I do have an online prescence currently, it tends to be centered around discussions of the Orlando Magic,
the NBA, or video games- not exactly what a potential employer is looking for. If a recruiter decides to Google me,
I want them to find something that displays my skills and willingness to learn. 
</p>

<p>
Essentially, what I want to do with this blog is document what I've been doing with coding, what I'm learning,
and what I want to do in the future. I'm going to consider it as my "coding diary". I'm not really sure
what I want the tone of the blog to be yet, I'm sure that my voice as a writer will come out over time, but as
of right now I'm sure that it will be pretty to-the-point and business-like.
</p>

<h3>We get it, you want to show off what you're learning, so let's hear it!</h3>
<p>
Well, the secondary purpose of this blog was actually to teach myself the ways of full-stack web development.
By the time I get the site hosted, I'm sure that it will look a heck of a lot better than it does right now,
but as of the time of writing, it is incredibly barebones. 
</p>

<p>
So far, what I have is the skeleton of a blogging site, made with the help of Gatsby, which is a React
based framework to easily create static-sites. Not exactly what I had in mind when I went into this project,
but so far it's doing a great job of introducing me to new concepts and ways of programming. This was my first
venture into React, graphql, Markdown, and frankly- web design in general.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this, my biggest web project was an "incremental-game" (think Cookie-clicker), but I focused more on the
Javascript and coding than I did the design, so it wasn't very impressive looking. I quite like the look of Gatsby,
and having created the back-end that I'll be using for this project, it's time for me to dive more into CSS and design.
</p>

<h3>What I've been reading</h3>

<p>
Something that I'd like to make a main-stay of this blog is an emphasis on books. I've been pushing myself
to read more as of late, particularly books on programming and technology. What I post in this section might not
always be completely relevant to the development aspect of the blog, but I figure that a good blog incorporates
at least a little bit of the outside world in addition to its main topic.
</p>
<p>
The most recent book that I've read that I'd like to recommend is a book on HTTP, called "HTTP, What Every Web
 Developer Should Know About HTTP", by K. Scott Allen. For beginners in networking and web design, like myself, this book 
 is a fantastic read. It goes through all the basics in a very understandable way, and introduced me to concepts that I would
 quickly run into when developing with Node and React. It was also a surprisingly fast read, taking me a little over 
 2 hours to get through. Overall I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a better understanding
 of the server side of web development.
