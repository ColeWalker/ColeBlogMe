    Beginning 100DaysOfCode has quickly become one of the best decisions that I have made in a long time. For those that are unaware of the challenge, it essentially states that each participant has to code for at least an hour each and every day for 100 days, and subsequently document what they did that day, on twitter or another platform. I have found Twitter to be the best option for me, as it allows me to document my work quickly, while also forcing me to adhere to the challenge by threatening a very public failure. Now, when I first saw this challenge, I was a bit skeptical. As someone who typically has little trouble with discipline in my learnings and work, I initially felt that it wouldn't benefit me as much as it would others. However, I will give just about anything a chance and ignore my prejudices in order to do so.

    Unsurprisingly, my initial judgements about the challenge were wrong. There were so many added perks to this challenge that I couldn't have possibly imagined. The first thing that I had noticed was the creativity I had been feeling. When I had decided to accept the challenge, I was seriously worried about having the creative ability to keep up with the hour-a-day format. I thought that I would run out of projects to work on, or things to do. Strangely, this hasn't been an issue. Each night, before I go to bed, I write down an idea or two for a potential project. As the days go by, I keep adding more and more to this now massive list of potential projects to work on. In fact, my fear of failing to maintain creativity has subsided, making way for a new fear of being able to get to everything that I want to!

    Another perk of this challenge is reducing burn-out. I tend to go a bit overboard when it comes to hobbies or self-teaching. In fact, when I was building this blog, I could spend an entire day just working on the code. On launch day I worked from 9am to 1am getting everything together! As one would imagine, this can result in heavy burn-out. It's always been an issue for me, and it's one that I haven't thought about fixing. 100DaysOfCode is great because I know that when I hit that hour, I've hit my goal. I don't need to continue if I don't want to, and that in some cases, it's better to stop. It also forces me to work on my "off-days", which were previously days that I took off of programming and self-teaching after heavier days. This level of consistency can only be good for me, and I'm excited to see my development as a programmer.

    Finally, the challenge has inspired me. Not just to maintain a consistent pattern of programming, but also in what this habit can turn into. I've been going through the twitter profiles of users who were documenting their progress through the challenge, and it was uplifting to see the advancements that they've made in their programming ability and understanding of the field, as I know that I too can reach their heights with consistent effort.

<h1> What I've been reading </h1>
<p>Since my last blog post, I blasted through Beginning Node.js by Basarat Ali Syed, and it was a very good introduction to the basic concepts of back-end development and provided a good baseline of knowledge that I'm sure practice and other books will build upon. My only complaints with this book revolved around the explanation for some of the more complicated ideas in node, there were more than a few occasions in which I required a supplementary resource to understand what the author was attempting to explain. However, I still feel as though the book was a fantastic resource, and definitely provided the jump-start that I needed into understanding node. </p>

After I finished that book, I decided to take my reading a bit off of the programming track, and onto something more socially focused. I have started to read The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane, and it is absolutely fascinating. In essence, the book discusses the characteristics of a charismatic person, and discusses ways that the reader can become more charismatic. This book reignited my love for sociology, as it goes into group behaviors and actions of an individual in a group setting. It is an absolutely amazing read, and I'd recommend it to anyone who feels that their social skills might be a bit lacking.
