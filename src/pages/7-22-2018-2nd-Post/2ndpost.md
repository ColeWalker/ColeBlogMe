<p>Prior to today, I had never given much thought into the design of my programs. In fact, I had never had
to design anything at all really; all of the projects that I've had to do for school were more about end-result
 than they were about user experience, and the same could be said about my own personal projects.</p>
 
 <p>This website, in all of its glory, is my first venture into the world of design, and frankly, I had a great time creating it.
One of my favorite things about programming is how puzzle-like it is. Coming up with creative ways to solve
problems works your brain in ways that you can really feel, and nothing quite compares to finally solving a problem
that you had been struggling with for several hours, or even days. Design satiated my thirst for creativity in a different manner.

Instead of struggling through algorithms, or working my way through a difficult-to-write function, most of the actual programming
of this website was fairly straightforward, there was almost no thinking involved in it. When I was building the framework and template of the site,
this made the whole venture seem trivial, and almost boring- there was no pseudocode to write, or  much to plan out. However, things really picked up when I realized that
I had to make something that was actually visually-appealing.

<h1>The Process</h1>
<p>
As I mentioned before, design wasn't really something that I had done prior to this project. It was somewhat of an anomoly to me,
I thought that it was merely a skill that some people possessed, and not one that could be learned. However, this did not dissuade me.
I immediately searched for resources on design, and made note of suggestions that fellow students were recommending.
One of the most common recommendations was to create an amalgom of the design of websites that I felt were beautiful. This was my starting point.
I mostly took inspiration from other blogs, but Google's Material Design has always been one of my favorites. The minimalism of cards
and the color palletes have always spoken to me, and I wanted to do something similar with my site.
